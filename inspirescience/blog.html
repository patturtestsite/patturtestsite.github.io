            <p>On our fifth and final day of Hicksville ISY, our session started off with a colorful experiment. Students began by pouring milk into a container and adding spots of food coloring. When they touched the center of the milk with their finger, the milk and food coloring remained stationary. However, after dipping their fingers in dish soap and then proceeding to insert their finger in the milk once again, students observed that the food coloring quickly traveled to the sides of the plate, creating a vibrant burst of colors. Why does this happen? The surface tension of the milk is reduced when dish soap is added due to the dissolving of the milk’s fat molecules by the soap. However, the surface tension of the milk outside the soap drop is higher so the milk’s surface is pulled away from that spot. The food coloring moves with the milk’s surface as the density of the food coloring is lower than the density of milk. Students were amazed to see the rapid movement of colors with just the touch of a finger! Afterwards, students indulged in making colorful mosaics of milk and food coloring. </p>
            <p>For our second lesson, we decided to end the program with a tasty summer treat- ice cream! However, this was no ordinary ice cream. Students were able to make their own frozen delights with the use of chemistry! By adding milk, vanilla extract and sugar in a sandwich bag, students created the basic mixture for their ice cream. Next, the sandwich bag was placed in an even bigger ziplock bag which contained ice and salt. The students then proceeded to shake the large bag vigorously. The salt added to the ice lowers the melting point of the ice, just as it does when we add salt to icy roads. In order for the ice to melt, it must absorb heat from the sandwich bag, cooling the ingredients in the sandwich bag and ultimately creating ice cream! Using only simple household items, we were able to observe chemistry in action as well as enjoy a delicious dessert. Students were surprised to see such simple materials turn into ice cream with only a few shakes! </p>
            <p>ISY 2019 was a huge success! Whether it was meeting a new friend, discovering a newfound interest in science or just a nice way to spend the summer, we hope that students took something from this program. It has been an honor and a phenomenal experience being ISY instructors this year and having the opportunity to meet these wonderful students with brilliant minds. Until next time!</p>

            <p>Our third day of Hicksville ISY concentrated on the vast and diverse field of biology. To begin, students learned about the scientific method, its purpose, and its applications in everyday life. The scientific method is an imperative part of any scientific career as well as in everyday life. Thus it is important to learn about the scientific method, for scientific inquiry is the key to advancements in our world. </p>
            <p>For our first activity, students explored the definition and components of chemical reactions. Chemical reactions are not a phenomenon of scientific labs alone, but rather they constantly occur all around us. Today we were able to observe one right before our eyes! Students blew up a deflated balloon using only the products of a chemical reaction between bicarbonate ions and hydrogen ions in a crushed alka seltzer tablet that was placed in water. The carbon dioxide created through this reaction became trapped in the balloon and we were able to then find the total volume of carbon dioxide produced from this reaction by calculating the volume of the balloon. At the conclusion of this experiment we decided to go all out and use 16 alka seltzer tablets to produce a large quantity of carbon dioxide. Students were thrilled to witness just how big the balloon got as well as examine the white fizzing display of the gas production. </p>
            <p>Next, students delved into the human body’s fast-paced messenger system - the nervous system. The nervous system is comprised of two main divisions; the central nervous system, which contains the brain and spinal cord,  and the peripheral nervous system, which includes the autonomic nervous system. The autonomic nervous system is a control system that acts unconsciously to maintain homeostasis.  One part of the autonomic nervous system is the reflex. A reflex is an involuntary muscle reaction to a stimulus. To see reflexes in action, we decided to test our very own! First we stimulated our patellar reflex by gently striking the top of our patella (knee bone) and watch our legs jerk up. Students were dedicated to finding the correct position to strike in order to stimulate this reflex. Next, we decided to test our visual-tactile reflexes through two different exercises. First, students dropped a meter stick above their partner's hands. Their partners were to catch the meter stick as soon as they saw it drop. Through this experiment, we were able to identify the person who had the fastest reflexes as they were the one who caught the meterstick the quickest. After that, we continued to test our visual-tactile reflexes by playing the human benchmark game. In this game, individuals had to click the smartboard screen as soon as they see it switch colors. Students were more than excited by this game and requested they play multiple rounds as they hoped to beat their previous scores!</p>

            <p>Time is flying by - we have already reached the middle of the week with only two more classes left to go! On our third day here at Hicksville ISY we delved into one of the most prominent fields in science - chemistry, the study of matter and the changes it undergoes. To start off our first activity, we decided to treat the students with something sweet for the summer weather - pink lemonade! The science behind the activity focused on the process of creating the pink lemonade. Since sugar is one of the primary components of lemonade, we decided to investigate how surface area affects the rate of dissolving using two different forms of sugar, granulated sugar and sugar cubes. After forming their hypotheses, the students conducted an experiment to discover that surface area does indeed affect the rate at which sugar dissolves, as they found that the granulated sugar disappeared much faster than the sugar cubes. This lead them to conclude that the greater the surface area, the faster the sugar would dissolve. In addition, students discussed how other factors such as temperature and stirring rate affected the rate of dissolving. At the end, the kids were more than happy to drink their sugary creations! </p>
            <p>Next up, the students explored the concept of non-Newtonian fluids by creating oobleck - and boy, did they get their hands dirty! A non-Newtonian fluid is a substance whose viscosity, or resistance to flow, changes in response to the amount of applied strain or shearing force. The students created oobleck by mixing different proportions of water and cornstarch. The result was a gooey mess - the oobleck acted as both a solid and a liquid, rapidly transforming into a fluid substance when no force was applied, and hardening into a solid mass when force was applied. To have some more fun, students used food coloring to create different colors of oobleck. It was pleasing to watch the students experiment with their creations, especially after understanding the phenomenon on a molecular level. </p>
            <p>The day concluded with an interactive game of Kahoot, where students competed in teams to answer questions about the new vocabulary and concepts they had learned.</p>

            <p>Our second day here at Hicksville ISY focused on exploring earth science. This branch of science serves to study our planet’s physical characteristics from earthquakes to raindrops, and floods to fossils. Our first activity focused on one of the largest planetary satellites in the universe - the Moon! We started off the lesson with background information on the Moon’s orbit around the earth and the lunar month, focusing specifically on the cycle of phases observed on the Moon throughout the span of this time. The Moon’s interaction with the Sun and other bodies in the solar system, as well as its properties and similarities to Earth were discussed. Students were excited to find out afterwards that their task was to recreate the lunar phases using Oreo cookies. This was certainly a plus, seeing that the kids not only received a sweet treat, but also became familiar with the shapes and names of the lunar phases.</p>
            <p>For the second activity, students had the opportunity to work in teams to create stream tables. We began with a lesson and accompanying video on the importance of rivers throughout history and in the world today, as well as the various features of a river system. Students then used sand and a continuous supply of water to recreate a river of their own. They were quite surprised to observe many of the same features they had just learned about in their own stream tables, including deltas, alluvial fans, meanders, and channels. Following the setup of their stream tables, we posed a question for the students - what factors affect the velocity or rate of flow in a river? With this in mind, we investigated the effect of the slope or steepness of the land on water flow by calculating the velocity of water when the stream table was angled at different heights. We concluded the lesson by demonstrating what happens when a river overflows its channel - FLASH FLOOD! </p>
            <p>It was wonderful to see that our students have grown more comfortable and at ease as they actively participated in the class discussions and experiments. </p>

            <p>Today marked the first session of Hicksville ISY! We were thrilled to see a classroom full of eager young minds ready to explore science with us throughout the course of this week. We had children of all ages, ranging from grades 3-6, sign up for the program. It was great seeing the enthusiastic interactions among all the kids as they were introduced to one another.</p>
            <p>To provide some insight on the HISY lesson plan and objective, our classes will be focusing on one particular discipline of science each day of this week long program. We started our week with a lesson on physics, one of the most fundamental fields of scientific study dealing with the dynamics of motion, energy and force. </p>
            <p>For our first activity, we focused on understanding how architects and engineers must consider various details when designing and building structures. We introduced the lesson by discussing real world examples of towers the students were familiar with and features they shared in common. The students then teamed up into groups and were given the task of constructing the tallest tower out of a limited supply of spaghetti strands and marshmallows. This icebreaker not only enforced stronger teamwork and communication among the students, but also served to demonstrate the importance of establishing a strong foundation or support system.</p>
            <p>Moving onto our second activity, we explored the kinematics of motion through a study of aerodynamics and the properties of distance, time, and velocity. After a lesson on airplane motion, the students were instructed to design their own paper airplanes while taking into account the various forces that are acting on an airplane during its flight such as drag, gravity, thrust, and lift. The students then took turns flying their airplanes and carefully recording the distance and time of flight. From this data, we were able to calculate velocity and determine what features or characteristics of their planes ensure it would fly the fastest. Once again, students were confronted with the critical decisions and planning that engineers encounter in the real world. </p>
            <p>It was a phenomenal first day and we look forward to the rest of the week’s program! </p>
