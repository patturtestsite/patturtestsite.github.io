          <p><strong>What is Cre-Lox Recombination?</strong></p>
          <p class="cms-repeatable"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past few decades, the science of Genomics
              has made leaps and bounds in terms of technological advancement. The development of gene editing
              technologies like the CRISPR Cas9 system and PCR allowed for the analyzing and the editing of the genome,
              which revolutionized fields like medicine, forensics, and even agriculture. One of these genome editing
              technologies, called Cre-Lox Recombination, is a site specific recombinase technology - a tool involving
              the use of recombinase enzymes to edit the genome, having the ability to carry out functions such as
              insertions, deletions, translocations, and inversions of target genes in the genome. Originally used by P1
              bacteriophages in nature, Cre-Lox Recombination has been harnessed by scientists as a tool for genome
              manipulation and mainly used today in the field of neuroscience due to its ability to analyze complex cell
              types and piece together the functions of neural circuits.</span></p>

          <p><strong>What is Cre Recombinase?</strong></p>
          <p>Before explaining the mechanism of action of Cre - Lox recombination, it is important to first understand
            the components. As hinted before, the Cre-Lox system consists of two components: the recombination enzyme
            and the DNA. The recombination enzyme in this case is Cre Recombinase, or Cyclization Recombinase, a
            tyrosine recombinase enzyme with a topoisomerase-esque function. Like other members of the tyrosine
            recombinase family, Cre Recombinase possesses a tyrosine residue in its active site. Its job is to recognize
            sequences of DNA called Lox P sites and catalyze the process of site specific recombination. The enzyme’s
            ability to operate within a wide range of organisms and cellular environments add to its value as a tool for
            scientific research.</p>
          <p><strong>What is a LoxP site?</strong></p>
          <p>LoxP sites are also crucial components in the Cre-Lox recombination system. Standing for Locus of X over
            (cross over) in P1 bacteriophage, loxP sites are areas in DNA derived from P1 bacteriophage consisting of 34
            base pairs, of which the first and last 13 base pairs are a palindromic sequence and are separated by a
            asymmetrical core sequence consisting of 8 base pairs. Because the loxP site consists of too many base pairs
            to appear naturally by chance, it possesses great specificity when it comes to genetic manipulation.</p>
          <p>The loxP site’s core sequence helps determine the direction of the site, which will have an effect on the
            outcome of the cre lox recombination event. The usual loxP sequence, or the wild type, is ATAACTTCGTATA -
            ATGTAGCT - TATACGAAGTTAT, but the 8 bp sequence can be mutated to form different core sequences. There are
            also a variety of different genetically modified versions of loxP sites, which gives Cre Recombinase the
            ability to catalyze multiple loxP recombination events in a single system, as different loxP sequences are
            not cross compatible. </p>
          <div class="image cms-repeatable"><img class="postImg"
                 src="../Images/Screen%20Shot%202021-02-23%20at%205.08.53%20PM.png"></div>
          <p><strong>Mechanism of Action:</strong></p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As mentioned before, this system uses an enzyme called Cre Recombinase to
              initiate site specific recombination between a pair of loxP sites. An important point to note is that
              these two loxP sites can be either located on the same strand or different strands of DNA. In Cre
              Recombination, there are two important conditions that affect the outcome: The position and the
              orientation of the loxP sites, but more on this later. In Cre-Lox Recombination, when an organism with
              loxP sites express Cre recombinase, the first step that happens is the recognition and binding of the Cre
              Recombinase on the first and last 13 base pairs on the LoxP site, which forms a dimer. The same event also
              happens to the second loxP site. Then, the strand or strands of DNA will reconfigure into a form that
              aligns the loxP sites into a parallel position and forms a tetrameter. The double stranded DNA is then
              broken by Cre Recombinase, rearranged, and reattached by DNA ligase. The end result of Cre-Lox
              Recombination activity is dependent on orientation and position of the loxP sites. If the two loxP sites
              are on the same strand of DNA and the orientation of the sites are of opposite directions, the gene
              between the two loxP sites will become inverted. If the loxP sites have the same orientation, the gene is
              cut out, and if the two loxP sites are on separate DNA strands, it is possible for translocation events to
              happen. LoxP sites on differing strands also can cause the merging of two plasmids in the presence of Cre
              Recombinase (as seen in the combination of two plasmids containing the lox 71 and and lox 66, image
              below). Another important note is that while the process of inverting the target gene is reversible, gene
              excision and translocation processes are not. There are two known factors playing roles in Cre-Lox
              Recombination efficiency. The first is the core sequence, where genetically engineered core sequences are
              usually not as high of recombination frequency as the wild type. The second factor that may influence the
              efficiency of action is the length of DNA between the loxP sites. The longer the length of DNA, the less
              efficient Cre-Lox Recombination becomes.</span></p>
          <div class="image cms-repeatable"><img class="postImg"
                 src="../Images/Screen%20Shot%202021-02-23%20at%205.09.49%20PM.png"></div>
          <p><strong>Significance and use: </strong></p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most important and common uses of Cre-Lox recombination is
              Floxing, or when genes of interest are </span><strong>fl</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">anked by
            </span><strong>lox</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">P. When genes are floxed, they are able to be
              expressed unless they are in the presence of Cre, at which point they would be disrupted or deleted.
              Floxing can help researchers identify phenotypes that are linked with specific genes. Another technique
              that can be used with Cre-Lox Recombination are FLEx switches, in which one of the loxP sites surrounding
              a floxed gene is floxed by a different loxP site variant. FLEx switches can invert a gene permanently by
              first inverting the sequences with the normal loxP sites surrounding the gene of interest then excising
              one of those loxP sites, which prevents further effects of Cre on the gene. Cre-Lox can also be used for
              limiting the production of certain cell products to certain cells at specific times. This is done through
              a process called Regulated Cre Expression wherein loxP sites are placed downstream of promoters active
              only in select cells and/or at select times, or by bringing Cre Recombinase to the cells at specific
              times. By regulating gene expression this way, scientists are able to identify gene activity in a much
              more controlled manner as well as being able to circumvent genetic embryonic lethalities.</span></p>
