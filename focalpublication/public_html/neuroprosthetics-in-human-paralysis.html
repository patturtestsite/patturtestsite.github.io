          <p class="cms-repeatable"><strong>Introduction:</strong></p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neuroprothetics encompass any output neural interface that can convert the
              brain’s intentions to external actions. These series of devices can substitute a motor, sensory, or
              cognitive modality or degeneration that might have resulted from damage from an injury or disease. Related
              to both neuroscience and biomedical engineering, neuroprosthetics, such as cochlear implants and visual
              prosthetics, are just beginning to emerge as viable interventions in the field of brain injury. The
              objective of neuroprosthetics is to rehabilitate individuals handicapped by injury through promoting
              independence and enhancing their quality of life.</span></p>

          <p class="cms-repeatable"><strong>Neural Prostheses Function:</strong></p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using a brain-computer interface (BCI) that bridges the brain and
              prosthetic devices, certain thoughts, like moving or flexing a muscle, create an electrical activity which
              in turn activates nerve cells and triggers brainwaves. Neuroprosthetics differs from traditional
              prosthetics because it is more closely aligned to how the human body functions. The brain sends electrical
              impulses that ultimately cause that limb to perform the desired task when a body part is moved. To
              translate signals, a BCI relies on either a chip implanted in the individual’s brain or electrodes.
              Electrodes on the scalp work sufficiently for simple control such as bending and straightening an arm, but
              electrodes implanted in a brain, or intraparenchymal electrodes, offer greater fine motor control like the
              ability to control arms.</span></p>
          <div class="image cms-repeatable"><img class="postImg"
                 src="Screen%20Shot%202021-06-06%20at%2011.30.27%20PM.png"></div>
          <p class="cms-repeatable"><strong>Individuals Affected by Paralysis:</strong></p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, the most common form of neuroprosthetics are the cochlear
              implants that substitute the functions of the eardrum and stapes while simulating the frequency produced
              by the cochlea. However, these devices intend to extend to those affected by paralysis and disabilities.
              Paralysis resulting from neurological injury or disease presents a significant burden on patients, their
              families, and caregivers. Neuroprostheses offer the promise of restoring movement to paralyzed patients by
              bypassing damaged regions of the nervous system, ultimately allowing patients the ability to live with
              greater independence and improving their quality of life. Recent advancements in neuroprosthetics have
              provided a groundbreaking neurotechnological solution for restoring function in paralysis. </span></p>

          <p><strong>Process for the Paralyzed:</strong></p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neural prostheses relied on the combination of an implanted electrode array
              in the motor cortex and functional electrical stimulation (FES) to muscles in the paralyzed wrist.
              Neuroprosthetics that combine BCI with FES can restore voluntary control of a patients’ own paralyzed
              limbs. Human studies have demonstrated an “all-or-none” control, like hand-open and hand-closed, where
              there is no middle ground. In order to make up for unnatural motion from the prosthetics, a BCI-FES system
              enables smooth control of limb movements through a continuum of states thus allowing the functionality of
              BCI-FES neuroprosthetics to manipulate objects of different sizes without dropping or crushing them. These
              innovations provide the groundwork for enhanced and more natural motor control of paralyzed limbs</span>
          </p>
          <div class="image cms-repeatable"><img class="postImg"
                 src="Screen%20Shot%202021-06-06%20at%2011.40.01%20PM-1.png" width="401" height="273"></div>
          <p><strong>Past Studies and Successes:</strong></p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, primates have provided ample evidence that neutrons in the motor
              cortex carry information related to muscle activation and force exertion that predict electromyography
              activity and dictate electrical stimulation in the primate’s arm muscle. Non-human primates regained
              control of their legs ­just six days following a spinal injury thanks to a neuroprosthetic interface that
              acted like a “wireless bridge” between the brain and spine, skipping the injury and restoring
              functionality to their limbs. Normally, lesions in the spinal cord partly or completely inhibit signals
              from the motor cortex from reaching the neurons that activate leg muscles, ultimately leading to
              paralysis. But, regardless of the accident, the motor cortex can still produce spiking activity through
              walking, and the neural networks activating muscles in a paralyzed leg are still intact and can still
              properly generate leg movements and contractions. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spontaneously
              regaining complete mobility after about three months, these primates could properly walk once the
              brain-spine interface was activated. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similar to primate studies,
              functional imaging experiments in humans have shown that increasing force production is associated with
              increases in blood oxygen level-dependent signals in motor regions. Clearly the developments in
              neuroprosthetics led to studies on humans that have been affected by spinal cord injuries that have
              affected the brain. </span></p>
          <p><strong>Restoring Muscle Movement:</strong></p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using the foundation that neuroprosthetics do in fact benefit the
              individual, a particular study demonstrates two important advances in restoring natural muscle
              contractions in paralyzed people. First, information related to graded muscle contraction intent is
              encoded in the motor cortex and can be decoded from intracortical recorded data. Second, tetraplegic
              humans can use this information and a BCI-controlled, non-invasive FES to regain control of graded muscle
              contraction in his paralyzed limb. The study observed distinct neural activity as the participant was
              asked to imagine exerting force to control a needle on a computer screen and match it to graded cue angles
              on a virtual protractor. The participant was then able to control the amplitude of FES to his own muscles
              to generate graded wrist flexion force against a resistance using his own thoughts. In addition to
              providing insights into the relationship between cortical neuronal activity and muscle contraction during
              voluntary hand movements, results also demonstrate an important advancement of neuroprosthetic technology
              that can help people suffering from paralysis regain the voluntary and smooth graded control of muscle
              activation that is necessary for manipulation of objects.</span></p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The study provides the first demonstration of continuous control of muscle
              activation in people affected by paralysis. Grasping delicate objects with varying weights with the
              correct amount of force are crucial for performing fine motor tasks that have now been uncovered by this
              study. On-going studies persist to enhance the natural behavior of the neuroprosthetic to mimic a human
              arm. Restoring grade muscle contractions will allow paralyzed individuals to gain functional independence,
              and neuroprosthetic technology is becoming a leading method to help those affected by stroke, immediate
              brain trauma, motor neuron diseases, and degenerative diseases like Parkinson’s. The potential for
              neuroprosthetics is unlimited and will continue to become more relevant. Neuroprosthetics is a growing
              field that has the potential to re-engineer the medical world. </span></p>
          <p><strong>Obstacles to Development:</strong></p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cost appears to be a looming obstacle in potential future revitalizing
              devices such as retinal implants and neuroprosthetic limbs, as they are roughly three to five times more
              costly than cochlear implants. Regulatory hurdles for approval and reimbursement also appear to be a
              hurdle in the process because companies are working towards global commercialization. </span></p>
