          <p class="cms-repeatable"><strong>Introduction:</strong></p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bacteria are becoming increasingly resistant to antibiotics, which is why
              antibiotic development has slowed down so much recently. Between 2010 and 2018, only 15 new antibiotics
              had been approved by the FDA, compared to the 63 approved between 1980 and 2000. There comes a time when
              you have too much of a good thing, and in the past decades, bacteria have been able to seriously improve
              their antibiotic resistance. We are in dire need of new ways to fight bacteria, and one of the most
              promising is none other than bacteriophage therapy. </span></p>

          <p class="cms-repeatable"><strong>Development History:</strong></p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bacteriophage therapy has been around for a century and was discovered even
              before the spread of antibiotics in medicine. French researcher Felix D’Herelle was officially the first
              to use bacteriophages to treat diseases, after he and Frederick Twort co-discovered phages in the early
              20th century. D’Herelle made his discovery in 1915 when he was assigned to investigate an outbreak of
              severe hemorrhagic dysentery among French troops stationed near Paris. D’Herelle was able to isolate
              bacterial agents, which he later named “bacteriophages&apos;&apos;, from patients’ fecal samples. He was
              immediately recognized for his work, later developed phage assays that are still in use today, and
              conducted the first bacteriophage therapy experiments in 1919 to treat patients with dysentery. Swayed by
              several successful experiments proving the efficacy of phage therapy, companies even began commercial
              production of phages for use against various bacterial pathogens. In the mid-20th century, bacteriophage
              therapy lost momentum in the West due to the eclipsing success of antibiotics, as well as its
              unpredictable results, which were mainly due to limited knowledge of phage biology at the time.
              Nevertheless, bacteriophage therapy would continue to develop in the Soviet Union thanks to D’Herelle’s
              Georgian colleagues. In fact, most of what we know about phage therapy comes from the Eliava Institute in
              the Republic of Georgia, where phage therapy is now part of standard clinical procedure, and the Hirszfeld
              Institute in Poland. </span></p>

          <p class="cms-repeatable"><strong>What are Bacteriophages?</strong></p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Phages themselves are simple, yet diverse nonliving viruses that infect
              bacteria. They are found nearly everywhere on Earth and come in many shapes and sizes. All bacteriophages
              are composed of nucleic acid encapsulated by a protein coat, which is known as a capsid. As bacterial
              parasites, phages can interact with the bacterial host in a lytic or a lysogenic growth cycle. During a
              lytic cycle, phages produce tens to hundreds of prodigy phages, which leave the host cell with or without
              killing. During a lysogenic cycle, phages integrate their viral genetic material into the host genome, so
              that when the cell divides, the virus is transmitted to daughter cells. Because lytic bacteriophages have
              the ability to kill bacteria, only these are used to treat bacterial infections. In fact, bacteriophages
              are ideal therapeutic agents because they can kill bacteria while also being harmless to the
              patient.</span></p>
          <div class="image cms-repeatable"><img class="postImg" src="gr1.jpg"></div>
          <p class="cms-repeatable"><strong>Past Research:</strong></p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the most important and detailed English language reports on phage
              therapy come from Slopek et al. in Poland. Slopek et al. conducted several studies on the efficacy of
              bacteriophage therapy on bacterial infections. 550 patients that had bacterial septicemia ranging in age
              from 1 week to 86 years participated in this study. Antibiotic treatment was ineffective in 518 of the 550
              patients, which is why the decision to use phage therapy was made. The etiologic agents used were
              staphylococci, Pseudomonas, Escherichia, Klebsiella, and Salmonella. Specific, highly potent phages were
              selected and then administered. Phages were administered orally; locally, by applying phage-containing
              dressings to wounds; and by applying drops of phage suspension to the eye, middle ear, or nasal mucosa.
              The phages were constantly monitored, and if phage resistance developed, phages were quickly replaced with
              different bacteriophages. Treatments lasted for 1 to 16 weeks, and the overall rate of success was 92%,
              and the rate of success for the 518 patients who found antibiotics to be ineffective was even higher, at
              94%.</span></p>
          <p><strong>Are There Any Potential Concerns That Should Be Addressed?</strong></p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the long history of phage therapy, there have yet to be safety issues
              reported in regards to it, but there are some related concerns, which should be taken into account.
              Several factors must be considered when selecting phages to use for therapeutic purposes. Phages should be
              lytic, but they shouldn’t have potentially dangerous genetic determinants, or the ability to transduce
              bacterial genes. Phage-resistant bacteria may even emerge, which brings up the possibility of
              antibiotic-resistant bacteria becoming phage-resistant, and at the same time regaining their antibiotic
              sensitivity. To counter this point, there isn’t any documented correlation between antibiotic and phage
              sensitivities. Also, the rate of developing phage resistance is much lower than that to antibiotics, but
              the rate of developing phag</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">e resistance could be slowed down by
              using several phages simultaneously, in a phage cocktail.</span></p>
          <div class="image cms-repeatable"><img class="postImg"
                 src="Screen%20Shot%202021-03-17%20at%2010.43.37%20AM.png"></div>
          <p><strong>What is the Significance of Bacteriophage Therapy?</strong></p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the negatives, bacteriophages have many advantages over typical
              antibiotics. Antibiotics usually target common processes among bacterial species, which can definitely be
              a positive aspect, but this could also cause dysbiosis. Most phages have narrow host ranges, limiting any
              side effects that could result from dysbiosis. Phage therapy is especially suitable for treating skin and
              wound infections, as well as deep tissue and bone infections. According to an article from D. Michael
              Olive and Joseph O’Connor from Nebraska Wesleyan University, “in order for an antibiotic to be effective,
              it must achieve a certain level in the blood or tissues”, but this can be difficult when treating “deep
              tissue and bone infections where drug penetration levels may fall below that need to treat the infection”.
              Phages are not this particular, and once a single phage finds its target, it can simply replicate and
              multiply across the area. Also, bacteriophage therapy might even be more affordable than antibiotics when
              targeting multidrug-resistant pathogens, as recorded in a study by Miedzybrodzki et al.</span></p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Around the world, growing numbers of scientists have come to recognize the
              promise of bacteriophage therapy. Soon after they were first discovered in 1915, bacteriophages entered
              the scientific world as a possible treatment for bacterial infections and diseases. They are now being
              applied in many fields, but with the decline of antibiotic development and effectiveness, phages are
              becoming a driving force in the clinical field that you should surely look out for.</span></p>
