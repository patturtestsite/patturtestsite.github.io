          <p class="cms-repeatable"><strong>Introduction:</strong></p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths
              worldwide. Early detection and treatment of CRC can greatly improve the chances of survival. CRC screening
              refers to the use of various tests to detect precancerous polyps or early-stage CRC before symptoms
              appear. Screening can help to find and remove precancerous polyps, which can prevent the development of
              CRC.</span></p>

                 alt="Acute myelocytic leukaemia (AML)"></div>
          <p class="cms-repeatable"><strong>Types of Screening:</strong></p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are several different screening tests available for CRC, each with
              their own advantages and disadvantages. The most common screening tests include:</span></p>
          <ul>
            <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fecal occult blood test (FOBT)
                - This test looks for blood in the stool, which can be a sign of CRC or precancerous polyps. The FOBT
                can be done at home using a kit that is provided by a doctor or health care provider.</span></li>
            <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flexible sigmoidoscopy - This
                test uses a flexible, lighted tube to examine the lower part of the colon and rectum. This test can
                detect polyps or early-stage CRC in the lower part of the colon and rectum.</span></li>
            <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Colonoscopy - This test uses a
                long, flexible, lighted tube to examine the entire colon and rectum. This test can detect polyps or
                early-stage CRC in the entire colon and rectum.</span></li>
            <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CT colonography (virtual
                colonoscopy) - This test uses a CT scan to create detailed images of the colon and rectum. This test can
                detect polyps or early-stage CRC in the entire colon and rectum.</span></li>
            <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stool DNA test - This test is
                done on a stool sample, and it looks for specific DNA mutations that are associated with colon cancer or
                precancerous polyps.</span></li>
          </ul>

          </div>
          <p class="cms-repeatable"><strong>Colonoscopy:</strong></p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most recommended screening test for CRC is colonoscopy. It is the most
              accurate test for detecting polyps and early-stage CRC, and it also allows for the immediate removal of
              any polyps that are found during the procedure. However, it is an invasive procedure and it requires
              preparation, sedation, and recovery time. Stool DNA test is also considered as a highly accurate screening
              test and it is non-invasive, but it is more expensive than other screening tests.</span></p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The American College of Gastroenterology recommends that adults aged 50-75
              should undergo screening for CRC, either by colonoscopy every 10 years or by stool DNA test every 3 years.
              However, the appropriate screening test and schedule will depend on an individual&apos;s personal and
              family medical history, as well as their preferences.</span></p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is also important to note that screening is not just for individuals who
              have no symptoms of CRC. If a person experiences symptoms such as rectal bleeding, changes in bowel
              habits, abdominal pain, or unexplained weight loss, they should seek medical attention and may need to be
              screened earlier.</span></p>

          <p class="cms-repeatable"><strong>Benefits:</strong></p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While screening for CRC can greatly improve the chances of survival, it is
              not without its limitations. False-positive results can occur, leading to unnecessary procedures and
              anxiety. Furthermore, not all precancerous polyps will develop into cancer, and not all early-stage CRC
              will progress to advanced stages. In some cases, the benefits of screening may not outweigh the potential
              harms.</span></p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CRC screening is an important tool for early detection and treatment of
              colorectal cancer. The most recommended screening test is colonoscopy, but stool DNA test is also a highly
              accurate screening test. The appropriate screening test and schedule will depend on an individual&apos;s
              personal and family medical history, as well as their preferences. It is important for individuals to
              discuss their screening options with their healthcare provider and to understand the benefits and
              limitations of each test. With appropriate screening, the chances of survival for individuals with CRC can
              be greatly improved.</span></p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is also important to note that screening is not just a one-time event.
              Regular screening is necessary to detect any new polyps or early-stage cancer that may develop over time.
              It is also important to maintain a healthy lifestyle, including a diet low in red and processed meats,
              high in fruits, vegetables and whole grains, and regular physical activity, which can reduce the risk of
              developing CRC.</span></p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another important aspect of CRC screening is follow-up care. If a
              precancerous polyp or early-stage cancer is detected during screening, it is important to receive proper
              follow-up care to ensure that the polyp is removed or the cancer is treated. This may include additional
              screening tests, such as a colonoscopy or a biopsy, as well as treatment options such as surgery,
              radiation therapy, or chemotherapy.</span></p>
          <p><strong>Challenges: </strong></p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the benefits of CRC screening, there are still barriers to
              screening that need to be addressed. One of the major barriers is lack of access to screening,
              particularly in underserved communities. Additionally, there is still a significant proportion of the
              population that is not being screened as recommended, due to lack of awareness about the importance of
              screening or fear of the procedure.</span></p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To increase the uptake of CRC screening, it is important to educate the
              public about the importance of screening and the availability of different screening options.
              Additionally, more efforts are needed to improve access to screening, particularly in underserved
              communities. This may include increasing the availability of screening programs, reducing out-of-pocket
              costs for screening tests, and providing transportation and other resources to support individuals in
              getting screened.</span></p>
          <p><strong>Conclusion: </strong></p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In conclusion, CRC screening is an important tool for early detection and
              treatment of colorectal cancer. Regular screening is necessary to detect any new polyps or early-stage
              cancer that may develop over time. It is important to maintain a healthy lifestyle, including a diet low
              in red and processed meats, high in fruits, vegetables and whole grains, and regular physical activity,
              which can reduce the risk of developing CRC. Despite the benefits of CRC screening, there are still
              barriers to screening that need to be addressed, such as lack of access to screening, particularly in
              underserved communities, and lack of awareness and fear of the procedure. With appropriate screening, the
              chances of survival for individuals with CRC can be greatly improved.</span></p>
